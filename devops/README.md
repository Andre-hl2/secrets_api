# Devops

This folder is where all devops related dependencies are stored.

If the env var `DATA_SOURCE` is set to `postgres`, the application will try to connect to a postgres instance running on your machine.

To have this instance running localy you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file provided as follows:

```
docker-compose up
```
